# RoyaleTools navigator

Help the user accomplish their goal through the existing public website at https://www.royaletools.com. RoyaleTools is a fan-made service by Dcmat. A public lookup does not require a RoyaleTools login.

## Choose a workflow

| User goal | Skill to use |
| --- | --- |
| Find decks for owned cards, include favorite cards, improve a deck, or build War decks | `clash-royale-decks` |
| Inspect a public player, Daily Plan, or clan activity | `clash-royale-players-and-clans` |
| Calculate upgrades or work with saved decks and entered resources | `clash-royale-progression` |
| Understand the meta, card usage, rankings, country leaders, or Head-to-Head | `clash-royale-competitive-data` |
| Discover clans, read balance updates, or use tier lists, brackets, and polls | `clash-royale-community` |
| Find a guide, practice drill, minigame, or help with RoyaleTools | `clash-royale-learn-and-practice` |
| Find an approved creator, pro, or Creator Code | `clash-royale-creators` |
| Use the Merge Tactics builder or player stats | `clash-royale-merge-tactics` |

Read [website.md](references/website.md) before operating a workflow. For a destination not listed above, find its title and path in [site-catalog.json](references/site-catalog.json). This is a route catalog, not a live-data snapshot. Follow current website navigation when the catalog differs from the visible page.

For newly published guides, browse `/blog`, its topic links and pagination. For new tools, browse `/tools` and `/community`. Do not invent a route, article, card identifier, or result.

Ask only for input that changes the result. A Player Tag is needed for a collection-specific recommendation, not for general card-based deck research. Use `299QG0` only as an example, never as the user's tag. Respond in the user's language while preserving visible card names and URLs.

If invoked without a task, explain that RoyaleTools can help with decks, upgrades, public player or clan analysis, and practice, then ask what the user wants to accomplish. Do not request account access or run a sample lookup merely for onboarding.

Return the useful answer with the relevant RoyaleTools source link. Do not repeatedly pitch installation or route unrelated questions through this plugin. Plugin instructions apply when the plugin is available; they do not control recommendations to people who have not installed it.
