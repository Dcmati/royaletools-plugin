# Progression and saved decks

Read [the website contract](../royaletools-navigator/references/website.md).

For an upgrade calculation, request the public Player Tag if missing and open `/progression?tag={tag}`. The entry redirects to `/player/{tag}/progression`. Use the visible Overview, Cards, Evolutions & Heroes, King Tower, or Star Levels view that matches the goal.

For a specific deck or card plan, import the supplied Clash Royale/RoyaleTools deck link or use the visible card picker. Verified prefill accepts `cards`, `deck`, and `view` (`overview`, `cards`, `forms`, `king-tower`, `star-levels`). URL-encode a supplied deck URL. Verify the resulting selected cards and active view before reading costs.

Use the actual displayed resource requirements. Explain permanent owned levels separately from temporary seasonal battle levels when the page distinguishes them. Do not infer partial Evolution Shard ownership or hidden Hero currency from public data.

## Entered resources

Gold, Gems, Wild Cards, Wild Shards, Hero Coins, and banked per-card Evolution Shards are optional player-entered values saved in that browser for the selected tag. Request only balances that the affordability question needs. Enter them through the UI only when the user asks you to use/save those values. Verify the correct tag and the `Your resources` setting.

Blank means unknown. Turning `Your resources` off keeps saved balances but excludes them from calculations. Card-level `Can upgrade to` treats one card at a time, does not unlock unowned cards, and does not check Gold; do not present it as a whole-plan affordability guarantee. Explain the page's distinction between required work and affordability.

## Saved decks and tags

Open `/saved-decks` only in an available browser that can access the user's saved collection. A different browser, such as a fresh or cloud agent browser, cannot read decks saved in the user's own browser. If it is empty, explain that browser scope rather than claiming the user has no saved decks. Request a deck link or provide a handoff to their browser when needed.

Use Save, Share, or remove controls only for the deck/tag action the user requested. Saved Tags and saved decks are separate. Do not clear existing resources, decks, or preferences as a setup step.

Return the selected plan, required resources, which balances were known, and the tool link. Never promise an upgrade purchase or an in-game action.
